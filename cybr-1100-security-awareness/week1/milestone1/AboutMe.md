Hi, my name is Cameron Phillips and I'm currently studying Cybersecurity & Networking at Hocking College. I attended Pickaway-Ross Career & Technology Center for the same subject. I've been interested in computers and networking for a long time, so I'm excited to really learn about advanced concepts and build compelling career skills. Previously I had two consecutive internships at Zane Trace Local Schools as an IT helpdesk. I'm going to try to work towards becoming a systems administrator or similar in my career. Some of my personal hobbies include self-hosting (mostly video game servers) and retrocomputing (restoring old computers).
