<h1>Final Project</h1>
I don't have many notes or old versions, the page is simple HTML, I went off of small previous experiences with how HTML works and Google.

I used this website for testing my code before I pushed it to Github, since the Github editor doesn't let you preview HTML files like it does with Markdown: https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_editor
