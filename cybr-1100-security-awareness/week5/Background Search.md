# Googling Self

Entering just my first and last name on Google, I wasn't able to find any information about myself. There are apparently fictional characters and real life noteworthy people who share my name, so those drowned out any immediate results for me. When I looked up my name, then my city, I was able to find actual results. I was able to find a blog post by the vocational school I went to which mentions my name. I was also able to find voter records, which lists my exact address and my parents.

# Absurd Laws

There aren't many stupid laws in Chillicothe today, but in the 1920s, they enforced "blue laws" which forbid the Sunday sale of gasoline, newspapers, and other items. The most absurd law I could find in all of Ohio: In the village of Glendale, it's unlawful to allow your ducks to run at large.
