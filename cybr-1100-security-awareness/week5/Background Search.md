Entering just my first and last name on Google, I wasn't able to find any information about myself. There are apparently fictional characters and real life noteworthy people who share my name, so those drowned out any immediate results for me. When I looked up my name, then my city, I was able to find actual results. I was able to find a blog post by the vocational school I went to which mentions my name. I was also able to find voter records, which lists my exact address and my parents.
