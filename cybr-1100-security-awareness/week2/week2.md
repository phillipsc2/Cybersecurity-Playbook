# Week 2
 
**Description:**  
We have covered further security basics, showcasing how easy it is to tear through weak security and reinforcing why it is important to stay vigilant in an ever-evolving field.
 
**Artifacts:**

**Case Project 2-4: Social Networking Assistant**

I investigated my Instagram account. I keep my account private. I only tie my phone number to the account for 2FA. I only add people I've personally met in real life, like family and friends, and even then I do not have many followers. Even if these peoples accounts were to be compromised, I never post my face or my voice, so there is really not much to leak. My password is also complex. I think my Instagram account is pretty secure, besides maybe the fact that I have my real name on it (listed as "Cameron P") but there's only so much anonymity you can do. I think the next best thing I could do is to not have an Instagram account at all.
 
**Reflection:**  
Going forward with this insight I will take more extensive measures to ensure my online security, especially my password strength.
