## Current State of Privacy

Generally speaking lawmakers have made some slight protections for users and their data, but progress on these regulations is largely held back by companies lobbying for their own interests and 
an overrall ignorance surrounding the subject. Apple and Google unsurprisingly do not have the users' best interests in mind, but their own. I think there is absolutely room for more to be done for 
the common user, it's ridiculous the lack of protection that exists today. I don't know exactly what you would do, but if I had to guess, the first place to start would be with how corporations use 
your data and sell it to advertisers.
