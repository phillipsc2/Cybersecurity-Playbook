## VPN Risks

There have been many cheap VPNs that compromise user security. The most famous example is probably NordVPN, where a single server in Finland was accessed by an attacker. NordVPN claims no logs were accessed. 
Other examples include PureVPN, who claimed to have a "no-log" policy, however in 2017 they provided logs to the FBI to help identify and arrest a cyberstalking suspect. IPVanish was similar in that they claimed to not keep any logs, 
but they were found to provide information to Homeland Security in a criminal investigation.

Three VPNS that claim to keep no logs or user data are Mullvad VPN, Proton VPN, and NordVPN. Based on the previous examples you could probably check if they work with federal agents or not. Based on my research, Mullvad VPN is 
probably the most legitimate VPN. It has a very good reputation for truly keeping no logs and maintaining security, on top of this it is a paid only service, which is not definitive proof of its quality but generally paid services 
that remain in business for a long period of time can indicate some kind of legitimacy.
