**Q1:** OSI Layer 3 is involved here, also known as the network layer it is responsible for packet delivery and routing across different networks.

**Q2:** First usable host: 192.168.50.1
Last usable host: 192.168.50.62
Broadcast address: 192.168.50.63

**Q3:** Two commands you would use to verify VLAN on Cisco CLI is show vlan, & show interface trunk

**Q4:** ip route 172.16.0.0 255.255.255.0 10.10.10.0

**Q5:** deny icmp any any echo

**Q6:** Physical interference (the signal can be weakened by devices like microwaves, bluetooth, cordless phones, especially if they are close to your computer.) and network congestion (too many people on it at once.)

**Q7:** Orange-White Orange Green-White Blue Blue-White Green Brown-White Brown

**Q8:** Network Layer 3

**Q9:** Iperf and SNMP 

**Q10:** 
| Question | Answer |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| A technician says a switch is forwarding frames but a router isn’t seeing traffic. | OSI Layer 3 |
| 192.168.50.0/26 | First usable host: 192.168.50.1 Last usable host: 192.168.50.62 Broadcast address: 192.168.50.63 |
| You create VLAN 20, but PCs can’t communicate. | vlan, show interface trunk |
| Router A can’t reach Router B (10.10.10.0/24 → 172.16.0.0/24). | ip route 172.16.0.0 255.255.255.0 10.10.10.0 |
| Management asks you to block all external ICMP echos. | deny icmp any any echo |
| Your Wi-Fi is dropping randomly. | Physical interference & network congestion. |
| What is the correct T568B color order? | Orange-White Orange Green-White Blue Blue-White Green Brown-White Brown |
| A user can ping their gateway but not 8.8.8.8. | Network Layer 3 |
| To measure bandwidth and device performance, what protocol and tool would you use? | Iperf & SNMP |
