In networking arrangements, star topology is when all devices are connected to a central hub (like a router). Mesh topology is when devices are interconnected or decentralized, forming multiple paths for data. Star topology works best for LAN networks because of its simplicity. Mesh topology is good for WAN networks due to its high reliability, if one part goes down it does not bring the whole network with it.

The difference between switches and routers is that switches are used to connect devices within a local network, while routers are used to connect multiple switches.
