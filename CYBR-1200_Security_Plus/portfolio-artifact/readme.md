# CYBR-1200 Security+ Portfolio Artifact
 
## Artifact Type
Security Controls Mapping
 
## Security+ Domains Represented
1.0 General Security Concepts
2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, Mitigations
3.0 Security Architecture
4.0 Security Operations
5.0 Security Program Management and Oversight
 
## Summary
A Security Controls Mapping project that systematically cross-references 18 key CIS Safeguards with NIST CSF 2.0 subcategories and the internal security controls of a fictional small bank ("HCB"). This demonstrates full alignment and coverage between CIS best practices, the NIST cybersecurity framework, enabling streamlined compliance, gap analysis and risk management for this business.
 
## Professional Relevance
It is a standard controls crosswalk that cybersecurity professionals create and maintain as core work and virtually every mature organization. In practice, security, compliance, and audit teams use exactly these spreadsheets to prove that one unified set of internal controls fully or partially satisfies multiple authoritative frameworks such as CIS Critical Security Controls and NIST CSF 2.0, providing auditable traceability.
 
## Capstone Connection
In the capstone project, I may reuse the Security Controls Mapping Table and expand it massively to match the real-world scale of security controls mapping documents.
